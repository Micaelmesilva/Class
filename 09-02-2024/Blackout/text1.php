            <p>A beautiful table was set in the dining room. There were candles, neatly arranged plates with a cloth underneath them, and cutlery beside them, glasses that would probably be filled with the blood-red wine on the table. Everything was so organized that if anything were added or removed, the table would lose its balance and thus its beauty. Everything was so perfect, yet there was no one there; that place seemed to reject the presence of anyone, that table so graceful and so solitary.</p>
