                The man began to hear footsteps around the house. He started walking toward the door to leave. With the flash of another lightning bolt, like an angel falling from the sky, he saw the beautiful woman descending the stairs with her chin dripping, the blood running from her mouth onto her chest.<br><br>

                The man ran, didnâ€™t look back, he ran. The door was closed. Another lightning struck, illuminating the house. The woman was in front of him, staring at him. In the darkness, in a moment of desperation, he grabbed the rack where the coats were hung and threw it at her, which did not help. The man knew he was going to die. He knew he had made many mistakes that night.<br><br>

                With the flash of another lightning bolt, it was revealed that when the rack broke after being thrown at the woman, it formed something like a stake. This light and this vision brought a glimmer of hope for survival.<br><br>

                The man ran, grabbed the stake, and drove it into the woman's chest. He took a few steps back, and when he leaned against the window, the lights came back on. The woman was on the floor, with blood all over her body.
