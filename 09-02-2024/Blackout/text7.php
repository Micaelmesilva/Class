            <p>
                — Knock, knock, knock — that was the sound of someone knocking on the door, near the man.<br><br>

                — It’s the police, open the door, please. — The man was in desperation. — If you don’t open the door, we will force our way in.<br><br>

                The man opened the door. His appearance was horrible: blood on his clothes and hands, and a dead woman behind him. Through the window, one could see a dead man sitting on the sofa.<br><br>

                — Good judge, this is how the compiled story stands. We heard the testimony of the man, the police officers, some neighbors, the company that sent him to the house, and those who were invited to the house.<br><br>

                — This is astonishing, I’ve never heard anything like this. Is the man on any medication? Is there any chance he was drugged or hallucinating?<br><br>

                — Judge, he was completely sane, but it is also very strange. And the gentleman who was sitting, where did he go? To be honest, as the police chief of this city, I don’t believe anything supernatural happened.<br><br>

                — Did the victim and he know each other?<br><br>

                — Nothing, Judge, no connection.<br><br>

                — A crime without motives? But what would be the motive for him to kill his coworker?<br><br>

                — Judge, I have no idea what could have happened. Even with all the investigation and seeking testimonies, this is the story we have. What will your judgment be?
