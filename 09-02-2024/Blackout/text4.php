                The rain seemed to intensify with every step towards the car. The beautiful woman remained at the door, watching them. They got into the car and started it... The car wouldn’t start. They tried again... The car still wouldn’t start. The men raised their heads and looked at the woman, who apparently hadn’t moved a muscle.<br><br>

                — Would you like to have something to eat and use my phone to call for help? — the woman said in a tone loud enough for them to hear.<br><br>

                The men entered the house, as they had few options. The woman took their coats and hung them on the rack beside the door; wet coats dripping water onto the floor. She led them to the living room where the fireplace was, so they could warm up.<br><br>

                — The phone is on the second floor — said the woman, pointing to the stairs. — You can stay in the living room by the fireplace. I apologize for not mentioning earlier, but I invited some friends over today. You can sit and eat with us. For some reason, I left two places open at the table.
