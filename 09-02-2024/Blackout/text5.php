                One of the men went upstairs to make the call. When he reached the phone, he started dialing the company's number to report the broken car, but only heard static; apparently, the wires had been cut. The man began to reflect on everything that had happened, from their arrival at the house to the current moment, and realized that something was very wrong. He went downstairs to be near his friend when all the lights in the house went out. A blackout. The man continued toward the living room to find his friend.<br><br>

                The fireplace provided some illumination to the room, and his friend could be seen staring intently out the window.<br><br>

                — Hey, let’s go. — No response. — Man, something’s wrong, let’s go.<br><br>

                When the man put his hand on his friend’s shoulder, he realized he was cold and had blood on his shirt. When the man shook his friend, his head tilted forward.<br><br>

                He was dead.
